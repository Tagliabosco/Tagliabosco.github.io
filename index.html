  <h2>Dayananda Saraswati</h2>
  <p>He was an indian philosophical writer and renunciate of the Sannyasa class. He taught Advaita Vedanta and made this available to the world through his writings.</p>
  <h3>Now, what is Advaita Vedanta?</h3>
  <p>The concept of Advaita is such that it encompasses all ontological aspects of the human conciousness and experience.</p>
  <p>It is a system to worship and develop a connection with Brahman and to realize your own potential. It is meant as a way to understand the fundamental aspects of reality in a way that does away with all belief in the physical world and structures one's life around the ultimate reality, which is the highest spiritual realization that all is connected to the one, which is the all-encompassign god Brahman and his avatars.</p><strong>What are the main differences between Advaita and regular Hindu practices?</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>It focuses on Brahaman, as opposed to a wide variety of Gods</li>
    <li>It is centered around non-dualism, there are no cosmic powers at odds</li>
    <li>It is focused away from prayer, since Brahman (God) is ever-present, he requires no "action" to be reached</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>However, Advaita is also similar to general hinduism in many ways</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>It is focused on reaching the highest state, that is, nirvana, enlightenment</li>
    <li>It is based on indic and vedic spiritual tradition</li>
    <li>It is focused on the spiritual journey, the <strong>Dharma</strong></li><a href="https://tagliabosco.github.io/Del2/">Inl√§mningsuppgift Del 2</a>
