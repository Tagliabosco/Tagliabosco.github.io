<h1>The path to Enlightenment</h1>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Swami_Dayananda_Saraswati.jpg"/>
<h2> Dayananda Saraswati </h2>
<p>He was an indian philosophical writer and renunciate of the Sannyasa class. <br> He taught Advaita Vedanta and made this available to the world through his writings.</p> 

<h3>Now, what is Advaita Vedanta?</h3>
<p>The concept of <em>Advaita</em> is such that it encompasses <em>all</em> ontological aspects of the human conciousness and experience.</p>
<p>It is a system to worship and develop a connection with Brahman and to realize your own potential. <br> It is meant as a way to understand the fundamental aspects of reality in a way that does away with all <br> belief in the physical world and structures one's life around the ultimate reality, which is the highest spiritual <br> realization that all is connected to the one, which is the all-encompassign god Brahman and his avatars.</p>
<strong>What are the main differences between Advaita and regular Hindu practices?</strong>
<ol type="A">
<li>It focuses on Brahaman, as opposed to a wide variety of Gods</li>
<li>It is centered around non-dualism, there are no cosmic powers at odds</li>
<li>It is focused away from prayer, since Brahman (God) is ever-present, he requires no "action" to be reached</li>
</ol>
<p>However, Advaita is also <em>similar</em> to general hinduism in many ways</p>
<ul>
<li>It is focused on reaching the highest state, that is, nirvana, <em>enlightenment</em></li>
<li>It is based on indic and vedic spiritual tradition</li>
<li>It is focused on the spiritual journey, the <strong>Dharma</strong></li>
